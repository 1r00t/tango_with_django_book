Thanks and Acknowledgements
===========================


To be honest this book would not have been possible if it were not for all the awesome folk out there on the web. The first version of this guide began because my students were struggling to pick up the Django Framework. It became painfully clear that the official Django Tutorials missed out some steps and that the students didn't know how to google to find out how to resolve any problems that arose, or that they didn't have the time too. I realised that to go from woe to go required a lot of additional information and help to resolve common problems. For this I often consulted stackoverflow.com for advice, help and explanations, along with other sites. So I wish to express my gratitude to all the folk who have posted such advice, help and explanations, and to those who were brave enough to ask the questions. In this book, we have amassed much of this knowledge and combined it to create this book so that students and beginners to web development can go through the process in a seamless fashion and learn the basics of web application development.
